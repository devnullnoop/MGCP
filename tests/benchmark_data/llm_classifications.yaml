# LLM Self-Routing Classification Snapshot
#
# Generated by Claude Opus 4.6 applying the routing prompt to each corpus message.
# This is a point-in-time snapshot — regenerate by re-running classification
# with a different model or prompt variant.
#
# Routing prompt used:
#   Classify the user's message into zero or more intents. Only include intents
#   where the user is clearly performing or requesting that action — not merely
#   mentioning the topic in passing.
