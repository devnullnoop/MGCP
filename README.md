## The Problem

LLMs are stateless. Every session starts from zero. The AI that helped you debug authentication yesterday has no memory of it today. Lessons learned, project context, architectural decisions - all gone the moment the session ends.

You've seen it: explaining the same codebase structure over and over, watching the AI repeat a mistake you corrected last week, losing important context when a session ends.

## What MGCP Does

MGCP gives your LLM **persistent context that survives session boundaries**.

```
Session 1: LLM encounters a bug -> adds lesson -> stored in database

Session 2: LLM has no memory of Session 1
         -> Hook fires: "query lessons before coding"
         -> Semantic search returns relevant lesson
         -> Bug avoided
```

**The primary audience is the LLM, not you.** You configure the system; the LLM reads from and writes to it. The knowledge persists even though the LLM doesn't.

### What makes this useful:

- **Semantic search** finds relevant lessons without exact keyword matches
- **Graph relationships** surface connected knowledge together
- **Workflows** ensure multi-step processes don't get shortcut
- **Hooks** make it proactive - reminders fire automatically at key moments
- **Project isolation** keeps context separate per codebase

### What this is NOT:

- Not "AI that learns" - lessons are added explicitly
- Not self-improving - you (or the LLM) improve it by adding better content
- Not magic - it's structured context injection with good tooling

**Honest framing:** This is a persistent knowledge store with semantic search, workflow orchestration, and proactive reminders. The value is *continuity* - accumulated guidance that shapes LLM behavior across sessions.

## Real Value Delivered

In active use, MGCP has:

- **Caught bugs before they happened** - lessons from past mistakes surface before repeating them
- **Kept documentation in sync** - workflow steps enforce doc review before commits
- **Maintained project context** - picking up exactly where the last session left off
- **Enforced quality gates** - workflows with checklists prevent skipped steps
- **Preserved architectural decisions** - rationale survives session boundaries

The system isn't intelligent. But an LLM with accumulated context *behaves* more intelligently than one starting fresh every time.

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **SQLite** | Lessons, project contexts, telemetry |
| **Qdrant** | Vector embeddings for semantic search |
| **NetworkX** | In-memory graph for relationship traversal |
| **MCP Protocol** | Native integration with LLM clients |
| **Hooks** | Proactive reminders at key moments |

## Key Concepts

### Lessons
Knowledge with triggers and actions:
```
id: "verify-method-exists"
trigger: "api endpoint, database call, store method"
action: "BEFORE calling any method, verify it exists in the class"
rationale: "We once shipped code calling store._get_conn() which didn't exist"
```

When the LLM queries "working on api endpoint", this lesson surfaces.

### Workflows
Step-by-step processes with linked lessons:
```
workflow: api-endpoint-development
steps:
  1. Design -> linked lessons: [api-contract, error-responses]
  2. Implement -> linked lessons: [verify-method-exists]
  3. Test -> linked lessons: [manual-ui-test-required]
  4. Document -> linked lessons: [update-openapi]
```

Each step surfaces relevant guidance. Checklists prevent skipping.

### Project Context
Per-project state that persists:
- **Todos** with status (pending/in_progress/completed/blocked)
- **Decisions** with rationale (why we chose X over Y)
- **Catalogue** (architecture notes, security concerns, conventions)
- **Active files** being worked on

Session 47 knows what Session 46 was doing.

### Reminders
Self-directed prompts for multi-step work:
```python
schedule_reminder(
    after_calls=2,
    message="EXECUTE the Test step before responding",
    workflow_step="api-endpoint-development/test"
)
```

The LLM reminds itself to not skip steps.

## Claude Code Hooks

Hooks make the system proactive:

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `session-init.py` | Session start | Load context, query lessons |
| `user-prompt-dispatcher.py` | User messages | Phase-based workflow routing and scheduled reminders |

| `mgcp-reminder.py` | After code edits | Prompt to capture patterns and gotchas |
| `mgcp-precompact.py` | Before compression | Save before context lost |

Without hooks, the LLM must remember to query. With hooks, it happens automatically.

## Beyond Software Development

The architecture is domain-agnostic. Replace the bootstrap with your own content:

| Domain | Example Lessons |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Customer Service** | Escalation triggers, resolution patterns |
| **Sales** | Objection handling, deal stage guidance |
| **Medical** | Symptom assessment, triage protocols |
| **Legal** | Document review, clause risk patterns |
| **Education** | Learning adaptation, concept explanations |

Same tools, different content.

## Agentic Workflows

> **Note:** We haven't built or tested this. Our focus is development workflows. The following is speculation about what the architecture *could* support.

Any agent operating across invocations faces statelessness. The components here - lessons, workflows, semantic search, hooks - could theoretically address that for agentic systems beyond coding assistants. We haven't tried it, but the pieces are there:

| Component | Potential Use |
|-----------|---------------|
| `add_lesson` / `refine_lesson` | Agent captures patterns from outcomes |
| `query_lessons` | Agent retrieves relevant guidance before acting |
| `workflows` | Multi-step processes with enforcement |
| Hooks (event triggers) | Inject context at decision points |

This wouldn't be machine learning - it would be **systematic accumulation** through explicit capture. The agent (or human) would need to add lessons when relevant; nothing is automatic.

A hypothetical multi-agent pattern:

```
Agent A completes task -> explicitly adds lesson about edge case

Agent B starts related task -> queries lessons -> edge case surfaces
```

**What would be required to actually try this:**
- Hooks/triggers integrated with your agent framework's events
- Discipline around lesson capture (garbage in, garbage out)
- Tuning of triggers to match how your agents describe tasks

If someone tries this, we'd be interested to hear how it goes.
