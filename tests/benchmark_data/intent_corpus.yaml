# Intent Routing Benchmark Corpus
#
# Ground-truth labeled user messages for testing intent classifiers.
# Each message has:
#   - text: The user message as-is
#   - intents: List of ground-truth intent labels
#   - category: Test category (direct, indirect, false_positive, multi_intent, no_intent, edge_case)
#
# Intent Labels:
#   git_operation        - Commit, push, PR, merge, deploy
#   catalogue_dependency - Library/package/framework mentions
#   catalogue_security   - Security vulnerabilities, auth concerns
#   catalogue_decision   - "Went with X over Y" style choices
#   catalogue_arch_note  - Gotchas, quirks, caveats
#   catalogue_convention - Naming, style, coding rules
#   task_start           - Fix, implement, refactor, build
#   none                 - No actionable intent
