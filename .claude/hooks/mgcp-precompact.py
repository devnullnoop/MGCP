CONTEXT COMPRESSION IMMINENT.

REQUIRED: Call mcp__mgcp__save_project_context NOW and SHOW THE OUTPUT.

Include:
- notes: What was accomplished
- active_files: Files you worked on
- decision: Key decisions (if any)

The save_project_context output MUST appear in your response BEFORE compression occurs.

If you have lessons or catalogue items to add, call those tools and show output too.

PASTE TOOL OUTPUTS HERE. Compression will lose anything not saved.
